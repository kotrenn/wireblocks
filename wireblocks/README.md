Overview
--------

Wire Blocks is a Tetris-style game with a twist:  each square in a new piece contains up to four wires.  The wires can appear in each of the four cardinal directions.  The goal of the player is to form paths which connect one side of the playing field to the other.  Upon forming a connection, the connected pieces will disappear in the same manner as a line will disappear in Tetris.
